Sand-Grain to Valencia

Just auto-pathing. Its not the most preferable solution, but it is the best I have to work with. With a t8 horse it really doesn't take as long as people think.

Get on the horse. Set my way-point to Sand Grain and press T. There is nothing on the way that'll attack you anymore.. Keep my sound on so I can hear if I get stuck on bandits. Tab and do something else (like this post, or work on my trading program) until I hear the mount stop.

Manually control the mount out of Sand Grain and around the right side of that cliff/ridge until I get [here](https://ibb.co/koaVev). Angle the horse so the line on the minimap matches the edge of the D, like in that picture. Auto-walk forward and you'll end up [here](https://ibb.co/n5jj6a).

Drop off crates onto donkeys at the stables. Go back across the desert in a similar way. Once at Sandgrain again, switch back to my processor by using "Transport" to send the Valkyrie to the next city I'll be picking crates up from.
